                  | Ever since my first computer-lab class in school, I have wanted to work in the field
                  | of computers and technology. I studied Computer Science for my undergraduate degree and started
                  | my career as a Software Engineer. A few years into life as a developer, I got the opportunity to
                  | work with user experience professionals. I was so excited and interested in what they did that I
                  | decided to go back to school. I spent two fantastic years at the University of Michigan learning
                  | more about design, user experience, and the fundamentals of human behavior. I have since worked
                  | at a UX design agency and in-house UX teams.
